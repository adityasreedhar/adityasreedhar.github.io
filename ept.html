          <h1 class="s3ddize" > I use EpochTimes for my news source because its an independent network that prides itself on releasing unbiased and trustworthy stories. While that is a great aspect, I noticed the user outlook was underwhelmingly low. For such a major company, the app had a small sum of users.</h1>

         <h1 class="s2dize" >CURRENTLY </h1>
         <h1 class="s3ddize" > As of August 6th, this app consists of an average design and an extremely poor interface and experience. There are a total of five tabs on the bottom and a dropdown menu on the top left for an even greater amount of options. The redundant use of tabs adds to the overall complexity of the app. On the other hand, positives include good use of typography and images.  </h1>

           <h1 class="s2dize" >THE GROUNDWORK</h1>
         <h1 class="s3ddize" > Knowing all the shortcomings of the original and public version, I decided to build the first rework of the app. It had the Apple media layout along with a new more relaxing color scheme. The main aim initially was to make the app simpler and remove every aspect of complexity. What that led to were three bottom tabs which included HOME, CATEGORIES, and SEARCH. While this was great, we noticed this approach brought its own set of new problems. We found the new app to be too lacking and barebones. There was no way to access the users' video section, notifications, or account preferences. To make matters worse, the new Apple media layout made images and text difficult to see. It was apparent that another redesign had to take place. </h1>

          <h1 class="s2dize" > ITERATION 2</h1>
           <h1 class="s3ddize" > After careful consideration of each element, texture, and design use, the final design looked something much more acceptable. The new design brought back the many features which were lost in the last iteration, at the same time retaining simplicity for the user. This version brings a new faded blue heading background giving more attention to the content. News articles now have a new box layout which allows for easier text reading and image viewing. This version brings back the video tab and the saved tab toward the bottom navigation. Clicking the person icon on the top left brings your notifications and settings.  </h1>

           <h1 class="s3ddize" > With an acceptable design standard being set, work to make the other pages had begun. The pages I created were opinion, videos, user panel, search, and an article. While following the same design cues, each page retained its distinct function and form. Each page had different components for the feed it was to show.    </h1>

           <h1 class="s3ddize" > To make way for a prime-time release, I had to make sure everything was the best it can be. I noticed I had space to increase the font size of a few media boxes. If you compare this with the previous image, you can see font sizes increased across the board to bring recognition to the article headlines.   </h1>
